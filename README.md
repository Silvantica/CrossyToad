A game where you guide a frog across a road. Written in Haskell!

## Basics

- You control a frog, the goal is to cross the road and then a river.
- On the road, cars and trucks are driving back and forth. If they hit you, you die.
- On the river, logs and turtles go back and forth. You can stand on their back but if you fall
  in the water, you die.
